Welcome to my JavaScript repository! ‚ú®
This folder contains different JavaScript files that I‚Äôve created while learning and building projects. Each file demonstrates concepts like variables, functions, DOM manipulation, events, and other core features of JavaScript.

The purpose of this repository is to practice, explore, and showcase JavaScript skills in a clean and organized way. It can be used as a reference for beginners, a base for small projects, or simply as a collection of useful scripts. üõ†Ô∏è
